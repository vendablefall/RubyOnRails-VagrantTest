Thanks for the challenge, if nothing more this task has opened my eyes to how disparate my skills are, My scripting/coding background is all Powershell, Javascript and C#. While my infrasctructure knowledge is all linux, I have not as yet delved into the world of .net on linux and as such this task posed a serious challenge to me, as I had never used vagrant before, or chef, or even built a single node webserver/db. (im usually ingesting AWS's PaaS and managed services at an alarming rate)

I chose VirtualBox as it is available to everyone, I was going to do this with the AWS provider, but I thought I would keep it simple to start off with.

My brother being a ruby developer pushed me in the direction of ruby, as it is a full stack framework and would help fill in the holes in my full stack knowledge.

This was also my first time implementing a ruby on rails framework, up until now I had used pre-established frameworks and just tweaked them to suit.

I realse I  did not implement Chef, as I had never used vagrant and chef before this test, I thought learning one technology at a time would be a better option. Even though I didnt fulfill this requirement I hope this shows my ability to learn technologies quickly, combined with my passion for I.T will make up for my temporary lack in knowledge.

You may have noticed i used the following guide:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

To build the app, as mentioned before this was my first time building a stack from scratch.

Sincerely
Alex Simpson
